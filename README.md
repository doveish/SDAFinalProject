# SDAFinalProject
Final project repository for JavaRemoteEE26 group 3 for a Stock Tracker Application.
# Description
The application was created for an assignment which required for a non trivial application as a solution to a problem.
The requirements for this project were:
* The appliction had to use a database in some way. 
* The process flow and the database structure overview had to be mapped.
* The SQL code had to be uploaded for replication purposes.
<p align="justify"> 
To fulfill the given conditions we chose a stock, transaction, dividend and account tracking application which 
allows the user to save the data to a database for future review. We also decided to add several calculation 
methods to simplify the tax handling of transactions etc. Our application allows the user to read and write 
stockmarket related portfolio processes via IntelliJ console in our test case. So without further delay,
please welcome PORTFOL_IO!
